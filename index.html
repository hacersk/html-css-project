        <h3> Helicopter Parenting</h3>
        <img src="img/helicopter.jpeg "/>
        <p>
          The term "helicopter parent" was first used in Dr. Haim Ginott's 1969 book Parents & Teenagers by teens who said their parents would hover over them like a helicopter. It became popular enough to become a dictionary entry in 2011. Similar terms include "lawnmower parenting," "cosseting parent," or "bulldoze parenting."
          Helicopter parenting most often applies to parents who help high school or college-aged students with tasks they’re capable of doing alone (for instance, calling a professor about poor grades, arranging a class schedule, managing exercising habits). But really, helicopter parenting can apply at any age.
          "In toddlerhood, a helicopter parent might constantly shadow the child, always playing with and directing his behavior, allowing him zero alone time," Dr. Dunnewold says. In elementary school, helicopter parents may ensure a child gets a certain teacher or coach, select the child's friends and activities, or providing disproportionate help for homework and school projects.

      <h3> Free-Range Parenting</h3>
        <img src="img/freerange.jpeg "/>
        <p>
          Almost as a counterpoint, what followed in popularity (and also controversy) was the Free-Range Parent. If hovering over your child’s every move was not a good idea then how about encouraging freedom, autonomy and independence? Though this term was first referred to in text in the 1940’s, Lenore Skenazy popularized it in 2008 when she wrote a column about allowing her 9-year-old son to ride a New York City subway alone. The response caused an uproar of opinions ranging from support to accusations of child neglect. Ten years later, American parents can’t quite decide what they think about allowing children the freedom to play in parks alone, walk home from school unattended or be allowed to play outside unsupervised.

        <h3> Tiger Parenting</h3>
        <img src="img/tiger.jpeg "/>
        <p>
          Then came the Tiger Mom. In 2011, Amy Chua published Battle Hymn of The Tiger Mother. Chua, a Yale law professor, shared with the world her strict style of parenting that required excellence of her children. This memoir caused a huge debate over whether an authoritarian style of parenting in which children are pushed and pressured to high achievement is harmful to children’s emotional and social development.

        <h3> Lawnmower Parenting</h3>
        <img src="img/lownmower.jpeg "/>
        <p>
          Lawnmower parenting — also called snowplow parenting and bulldozer parenting — happens when parents go out of their way to remove obstacles from their children's lives.
          The lawnmower parenting style received national attention recently when it came to light that high-profile celebrities allegedly did immoral or illegal things to help their kids get into college.
          Experts say lawnmower parents make it harder for their kids to function on their own as adults.
          Lawnmower parents are over-involved in their kids lives, to the point of not giving their children a chance to figure out anything on their own. "The parents are doing everything they can to clear a path for their children," says Carla Naumburg, Ph.D., a clinical social worker and the author of the upcoming book How to Stop Losing Your Sh*t With Your Kids. "These parents don't want their kids to ever hit a wall, or trip and fall, or lose their way, so they're constantly putting themselves out ahead, doing their best to make sure their kids have the easiest journey possible." Lawnmower parenting is like helicopter parenting, but worse.
